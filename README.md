Proxy configuration files
=========================

For use with my [`tailproxy`](https://github.com/gbraad/dotfiles/blob/main/zsh/.local/bin/start-tailproxy) command as used in [dotfiles](https://github.com/gbraad/dotfiles) and [devenv](https://github.com/gbraad/devenv/).


### Usage
To run a server, consider the following:
  * https://github.com/spotsnel/tailscale-tailwings
  * https://github.com/spotsnel-fedora/dante-packages (`dante` and `dante-server`)

Proxy client packages for Fedora/EL are available here:
  * https://github.com/spotsnel-fedora/dante-server-packages (`dante` is the client library)
  * https://github.com/spotsnel-fedora/tsocks-packages
